	  <h2>Fun facts:</h2>
	  <ul>
		  <li>I'm wild about anything spooky, especially history or true crime</li>
		  <li>I think octopus are neat</li>
		  <li>I have video proof of me chopping a thrown apple in half with a Civil War cavalry sword</li>
		  <li>My Dragonball Z fansite was featured in a magazine when I was a kid</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2>The rest</h2>
	  <p>I could never decide what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wanted to be an artist, a criminologist, a programmer, a psychologist, a researcher, a teacher. Though I first started making websites when I was 11 years old, I ended up going into Psychology. I got a Bachelors from Bradley University and a Masters from Florida Atlantic University. I got a job as an instructor at Illinois Central College. After deciding to leave academia, a former professor helped me find my way to a career that would combine all of those childhood aspirations (except criminology, but we'll see where my career takes me).</p>
	  <p>I ended up going to DePaul University for a second Masters in Human-Computer Interaction. Through that program, I've gotten many wonderful opportunities to grow in a career that allows me to impact so many things.</p>
	  <p>My career has been defined by my inability to pick a lane and stay in it. So I don't.</p>
