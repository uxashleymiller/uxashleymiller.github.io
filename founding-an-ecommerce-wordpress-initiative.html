      <h1>Founding an eCommerce Wordpress initiative</h1>
      <img src="images/wordpress/hero.png" class="full" alt="A laptop showing the landing page of an online store" />
	  <h2>Project</h2>
	  <p>The salespeople within the company often needed to create microsites for their clients to sell branded products. The existing inventory management software was so niche that a single developer existed for it. That single developer was expensive, severely backlogged, and created mid-90s-esque websites.</p>
	  <p>After redesigning the blog for the Blue Soda Promo website and seeing the work by another designer, I believed I had a solution.</p>
<ul>
	    <li>My role: Lead designer, website manager</li>
	    <li>Team: Developer</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h2>Objective</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Find a way to streamline the creation of eCommerce microsites</li>
    </ul>
	  <h2>Work</h2>
	  <p>I created a quick proposal for my boss: Let me use Wordpress, which we've already used successfully for the blog and our designer was using to make another microsite for a niche product, to create a series of eCommerce sites. I had even found a plugin developer that would be able to integrate with the ancient inventory management software, given the right attributes.</p>
		<p>My boss approved the idea and I got to work.</p>
	  
	  <h2>End result</h2>
	  <p>My eCommerce initiative was a wild success. I could knock them out in a week or two, work directly with the salespeople and clients, and my websites saved the company approximately $60,000 per site I created. They were infinitely more valuable because I could then also train the salespeople to update the products as necessary.</p>

	  <h2>Reflection</h2>
	  <p>This was relatively early on in my career, before I completed my Human-Computer Interaction degree. It was wildly out of the scope of the data entry job I'd been hired for, but I saw an opportunity to fix a big issue some of my coworkers had. I think it was here that I started building the confidence I would need in later jobs. Since then, I've grown even more incapable of staying in my own lane.</p>
